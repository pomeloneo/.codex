# Strategic Compact Skill

Suggests manual `/compact` at strategic points in your workflow rather than relying on arbitrary auto-compaction.

## When to Activate

- Running long sessions that approach context limits (200K+ tokens)
- Working on multi-phase tasks (research → plan → implement → test)
- Switching between unrelated tasks within the same session
- After completing a major milestone and starting new work
- When responses slow down or become less coherent (context pressure)

## Why Strategic Compaction?

Auto-compaction triggers at arbitrary points:
- Often mid-task, losing important context
- No awareness of logical task boundaries
- Can interrupt complex multi-step operations

Strategic compaction at logical boundaries:
- **After exploration, before execution** — Compact research context, keep implementation plan
- **After completing a milestone** — Fresh start for next phase
- **Before major context shifts** — Clear exploration context before different task

## How It Works

The `suggest-compact.js` script runs on PreToolUse (Edit/Write) and:

1. **Tracks tool calls** — Counts tool invocations in session
2. **Threshold detection** — Suggests at configurable threshold (default: 50 calls)
3. **Periodic reminders** — Reminds every 25 calls after threshold

## Optional Hook Setup

If your Codex environment supports equivalent hooks, adapt this pattern to the active Codex configuration. Otherwise, use the decision guide below as a manual checkpoint.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/.codex/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.js" }]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/.codex/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.js" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `COMPACT_THRESHOLD` — Tool calls before first suggestion (default: 50)

## Compaction Decision Guide

Use this table to decide when to compact:

| Phase Transition | Compact? | Why |
|-----------------|----------|-----|
| Research → Planning | Yes | Research context is bulky; plan is the distilled output |
| Planning → Implementation | Yes | Plan is in the current plan or a file; free up context for code |
| Implementation → Testing | Maybe | Keep if tests reference recent code; compact if switching focus |
| Debugging → Next feature | Yes | Debug traces pollute context for unrelated work |
| Mid-implementation | No | Losing variable names, file paths, and partial state is costly |
| After a failed approach | Yes | Clear the dead-end reasoning before trying a new approach |

## What Survives Compaction

Understanding what persists helps you compact with confidence:

| Persists | Lost |
|----------|------|
| AGENTS.md instructions | Intermediate reasoning and analysis |
| Current plan or plan file | File contents you previously read |
| Persisted project notes | Multi-step conversation context |
| Git state (commits, branches) | Tool call history and counts |
| Files on disk | Nuanced user preferences stated verbally |

## Handoff Note Template

When a task must continue in another session, write a concise handoff note before compacting or stopping. Save it outside the current workspace unless the user asks for a project artifact.

Include:

- Objective and current status
- Important decisions already made
- Files changed and commands already run
- Validation completed and validation still missing
- Known risks, blockers, and assumptions
- Suggested skills or workflows for the next session
- Exact next steps

Do not duplicate content already captured in PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, or diffs. Reference those artifacts by path or URL. Redact API keys, tokens, passwords, and personal information.

## Best Practices

1. **Compact after planning** — Once the plan is finalized in the current plan or a file, compact to start fresh
2. **Compact after debugging** — Clear error-resolution context before continuing
3. **Don't compact mid-implementation** — Preserve context for related changes
4. **Read the suggestion** — The hook tells you *when*, you decide *if*
5. **Write before compacting** — Save important context to files or memory before compacting
6. **Use `/compact` with a summary** — Add a custom message: `/compact Focus on implementing auth middleware next`

## Token Optimization Patterns

### Trigger-Table Lazy Loading
Instead of loading full skill content at session start, use a trigger table that maps keywords to skill paths. Skills load only when triggered, reducing baseline context by 50%+:

| Trigger | Skill | Load When |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "test", "tdd", "coverage" | tdd-workflow | User mentions testing |
| "security", "auth", "xss" | security-review | Security-related work |
| "deploy", "ci/cd" | deployment-patterns | Deployment context |

### Context Composition Awareness
Monitor what's consuming your context window:
- **AGENTS.md files** — Always loaded, keep lean
- **Loaded skills** — Each skill adds 1-5K tokens
- **Conversation history** — Grows with each exchange
- **Tool results** — File reads, search results add bulk

### Duplicate Instruction Detection
Common sources of duplicate context:
- Same rules repeated across `AGENTS.md`, skills, and project docs
- Skills that repeat AGENTS.md instructions
- Multiple skills covering overlapping domains

### Context Optimization Tools
- `token-optimizer` MCP — Automated 95%+ token reduction via content deduplication
- `context-mode` — Context virtualization (315KB to 5.4KB demonstrated)
