description: "Brainstorm based on user input to organize feature points, assess change scope, and explore technical solutions as a Lark document."

---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

If the given `$ARGUMENTS` contains a link, you need to read the content of the link (use lark-docs mcp if it's a lark doc) and replace the link with content.

## Context
**Read context before Executing**:
1. Language Setting
   - Read `preferred_language` from `.ttadk/config.json` (default: 'en' if missing). **IMPORTANT** **Use the configured language for ALL outputs: 'en' → English, 'zh' → 中文. This applies to: generated documents (specs, plans, tasks), interactive prompts, confirmations, status messages, and error descriptions.**

## Outline

Execute the following workflow to brainstorm and analyze based on user input, ultimately producing a structured concise technical proposal.

<HARD-GATE>
Before the technical proposal is explicitly approved by the user, it is strictly forbidden to:
- Write any implementation code
- Create files or scaffolding
- Modify any configuration or feature flags
This rule applies to all projects, no matter how simple they may seem.

**"Explicitly approved" means ONLY when the user selects "Approved, generate technical proposal" in Step 7.**
- Confirmations at Steps 1–6 (e.g., "Correct, proceed") do NOT grant any permission to write code.
- Step 7 approval only authorizes generating the brainstorm output document — it does NOT authorize writing implementation code, nor does it authorize proceeding to specify/plan/implement.
- After generating the brainstorm document, this command is COMPLETE. Do NOT automatically continue to implementation. Guide the user to manually execute the next command.
</HARD-GATE>

**Core Principles**:
1. **User Confirmation First**: When encountering ambiguous, unclear, or decision-requiring information, you must **immediately pause** and ask the user for confirmation. **Never assume or make decisions on your own**. All AI-inferred content must be labeled "[AI Inference]".
2. **One Question at a Time**: Do not ask multiple questions in a single message to avoid information overload. If clarification is needed across multiple dimensions, split them into separate questions.
3. **YAGNI Principle**: Proactively trim unnecessary features. "Simple" requirements are the most prone to overlooked details, but designs can be brief (a few sentences) — they just can't be skipped.
4. **Proposals Must Be Compared**: Present at least 2 viable proposals for trade-off analysis. Avoid letting the first idea that comes to mind become the final proposal.

---

### Step 1: Parse User Input

#### 1.1 Identify and Read Input Content

1. **Identify input type**:
   - **Lark link**: Detect if it contains `bytedance.larkoffice.com`, `feishu.cn`, or `larksuite.com`
   - **Local file**: Detect if it starts with `/`, or contains common file extensions (`.md`, `.txt`, `.go`, `.py`, `.java`, etc.)
   - **Plain text**: Default to plain text description for all other cases

2. **Read content**:
   ```
   IF Lark link:
     Use mcp__lark-docs__export_lark_doc_markdown to export
     Read the exported markdown content
   ELSE IF local file:
     Use the Read tool to read the file content
   ELSE:
     Use the input text content directly
   ```

3. **Error handling**:
   - Empty input: Prompt "Please provide input content (text, file path, or Lark link)"
   - File not found: Prompt "File not found: [path]"
   - Invalid Lark link: Prompt "Unable to access Lark document, please check the link or permissions"
   - Content too long: Auto-truncate and prompt "Content too long, truncated for processing"

#### 1.2 Summarize Content and Confirm Objective

Summarize the parsed content, extract key information (functional requirements, business rules, technical highlights), then use the AskUserQuestion tool to confirm:

**Question**: Please confirm whether the above summary is accurate and your objective
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Correct, generate concise technical proposal | Summary is accurate, proceed to generate the technical proposal |
| Summary is inaccurate, let me supplement | Need to revise the summary content |

#### 1.3 Confirm Tech Stack

After the user confirms the summary, **ask about the tech stack separately**:

**Question**: Please select the tech stack involved in this requirement
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Backend | Server-side development (Go/Java/Python, etc.) — focuses on IDL, DB, RPC interfaces, service code |
| Frontend | Web frontend development (React/Vue, etc.) — focuses on API interfaces, page components, state management |
| Client | Mobile development (iOS/Android/Flutter, etc.) — focuses on native interfaces, UI components, local storage |

**Tech stack determines subsequent template selection**:
- **Backend** → Use `brainstorm-output-template.md` (IDL/DB/code layering structure)
- **Frontend** → Use `brainstorm-output-template-frontend.md` (page/component/API/state management structure)
- **Client** → Use `brainstorm-output-template.md` (reuse backend template, adapted with mobile terminology)

---

### Step 2: Feature Breakdown and Focus Selection

#### 2.1 Analyze Input Content

Based on the user's requirement input, identify the functional modules and feature points it contains:

1. **Analysis dimensions**:
   - **Functional modules**: Grouped by business domain (e.g., orders, creator fulfillment, payments, etc.)
   - **Feature points**: Specific features under each module (e.g., new API endpoint, status validation, data query, etc.)

2. **Breakdown principles**:
   - Each feature point should be an independently deliverable minimum unit
   - Feature point granularity examples:
     - "New reverse-selection API" (specific)
     - "CPT payment status validation" (specific)
     - "Reverse-selection feature" (too coarse)
     - "Payment module" (too coarse)

#### 2.2 Display Feature Point List and User Selection

```markdown
## Feature Point Analysis

Based on your requirements, I identified the following functional modules and feature points:

### Module A: [Module Name]
| ID | Feature Point | Brief Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | [Feature Point 1] | [Description] |
| A2 | [Feature Point 2] | [Description] |

### Module B: [Module Name]
| ID | Feature Point | Brief Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | [Feature Point 1] | [Description] |
| B2 | [Feature Point 2] | [Description] |
```

Use the AskUserQuestion tool with multi-select (multiSelect: true):
- Dynamically generate options based on identified feature points
- Each option format: `[ID] [Feature Point Name] - [Brief Description]`

---

### Step 3: Explore Project Context

**Core Principle**: Make no assumptions — read the code repository directly for real information.

#### 3.1 Obtain System Architecture Information

1. **Attempt to retrieve architecture information from context**:
   - Search for `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/` and other files in the current directory or user-specified directory
   - Read system architecture, service partitioning, tech stack, and other information from them

2. **Read compound knowledge assets** (if available):
   - **IF EXISTS**: Scan `docs/` for available knowledge assets (e.g., check `docs/arch/`, `docs/references/`, root-level `docs/*.md`). Load whichever files are relevant to the current task based on their filenames and contents — do not rely on a hardcoded list.
   - Use these assets to enrich project context understanding and inform the brainstorm

3. **Review Git history**:
   - Review the most recent 20 commits for the involved projects
   - Identify recent modification hotspots and understand code evolution trends

4. **If architecture information is not found, ask the user to provide it**:
   Use the AskUserQuestion tool:
   ```markdown
   No system architecture information found in the current context. Please provide the involved services/projects:
   ```

#### 3.2 Read Code to Obtain Core Entities

**Warning**: All information below must be read directly from the code repository — no guessing allowed.

**If no code repository path is available, you must first ask the user to provide one**.

**Backend projects**:
1. Read IDL files: `idl/**/*.thrift`, `idl/**/*.proto`
2. Read database table structures: `pkg/migration/mysql/**/*.sql`, `sql/**/*.sql`
3. Read core code structure: Handler/Service/DAO layered code

**Frontend projects**:
1. Read project configuration: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
2. Read route definitions: `src/router/**`, `src/pages/**`
3. Read API definitions: `src/api/**`, `src/services/**`
4. Read state management: `src/store/**`, `src/models/**`
5. Read component structure: `src/components/**`

#### 3.3 Present Structured Results and Confirm

Present the retrieved information in a structured format to the user, using the AskUserQuestion tool to confirm:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Information is correct, proceed | Analysis results are accurate |
| Information is incorrect or incomplete, let me supplement | Needs correction |
| Need to analyze more projects/files | Continue exploring |

---

### Step 4: Iterative Clarification Questions

Based on the information collected so far, **ask only one question at a time** to deeply understand the requirement details.

**Questioning strategy**:
- Prefer multiple-choice over open-ended questions
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria, edge cases
- Only move to the next question after the current one is fully answered
- If a topic needs further exploration, split it into multiple questions

**Questioning directions** (select as needed, not every one is required):
1. **Business constraints**: Are there performance requirements, data volume expectations, or concurrency scenarios?
2. **Edge cases**: How to handle exception scenarios? Is idempotency/retry needed?
3. **Dependencies**: Does this depend on changes from other services/teams?
4. **Compatibility**: Is backward compatibility with older versions needed? Is there a gradual rollout strategy?
5. **Testing criteria**: What constitutes passing acceptance?

**Termination condition**: When your understanding of the requirements is sufficient to propose a clear technical proposal, inform the user: "I have a thorough understanding of the requirements. Next, I will propose options for your selection," then proceed to Step 5.

---

### Step 5: Propose 2-3 Options and Compare

You **must** propose at least 2 viable options, even if one seems obvious.

#### 5.1 Option Presentation

```markdown
## Option Comparison Analysis

| Comparison Dimension | Option A: [Name] | Option B: [Name] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Approach** | [Description] | [Description] |
| **Scope of Changes** | [Scope] | [Scope] |
| **Development Cost** | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| **Risk Points** | [Risks] | [Risks] |
| **Extensibility** | [Assessment] | [Assessment] |

**Recommendation**: Option [X], Reason: [Specific reason]
```

#### 5.2 User Selection

Use the AskUserQuestion tool:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Option A | [Option A name] |
| Option B | [Option B name] |
| I have a different idea | User-defined option |

---

### Step 6: Present Design in Sections

Based on the user's selected option, **present the detailed design in sections**, obtaining user confirmation after each section.

#### 6.1 Present Expected Scope of Changes

```markdown
## Expected Scope of Changes

### Involved Services/Projects
| Service (PSM) | Project Path | Change Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Service Name] | [Path] | New/Modified |
```

**Additional display for backend projects**:

```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Correct, proceed | Scope of changes is accurate |
| Incorrect, let me supplement | Needs adjustment |

#### 6.2 Core Change Analysis (Presented per Feature Point)

For each selected feature point, present detailed change analysis. After each feature point is presented, ask the user if it's accurate.

**Backend feature point template**:
```markdown
### Feature Point: [A1] [Feature Point Name]

#### IDL Changes
| Change Type | Object | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [New/Modified] | [Service#Method or Struct] | [Description] |

#### DB Changes
| Change Type | Table/Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [New/Modified] | [table_name.field] | [Description] |

#### Code Changes
| # | Change Type | File/Method | Change Content | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | New | `handler/xxx.go#NewHandler` | New API handler function | Receive request |

#### Call Chain
`Request → Handler → Service → DAO → DB`
```

**Frontend feature point template**:
```markdown
### Feature Point: [A1] [Feature Point Name]

#### Page/Component Changes
| Change Type | Component/Page | File Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [New/Modified] | [Component Name] | [File Path] | [Description] |

#### API Calls
| API Path | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [/api/xxx] | GET/POST | [Description] |

#### State Management
| Store/Model | Change Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Store Name] | [New/Modified] | [Description] |

#### Interaction Flow
`User Action → Component Event → API Call → State Update → UI Render`
```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm after each feature point:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Correct, proceed to next | Analysis is accurate |
| Incorrect, let me supplement | Needs adjustment |

---

### Step 7: Proposal Confirmation

Consolidate the design of all feature points, present the complete proposal summary, and request the user's final confirmation.

```markdown
## Proposal Summary

**Selected Option**: [Option Name]
**Involved Projects**: [N]
**Feature Points**: [N]
**Estimated Changed Files**: [N]

### Risk Points
1. **[Risk Type]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Risk Type]**: [Brief description]

---

Does the above design pass review?
```

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Approved, generate technical proposal | Proposal confirmed, generate final document |
| Needs modification | Return to modify (specify what needs to be changed) |

> **CRITICAL**: The options above must contain ONLY these two choices. Do NOT add any option like "Approved and start implementing", "Proceed to coding", or any similar wording that implies implementation. Approval here means generating the brainstorm document only — implementation requires the user to manually trigger a separate command.

---

### Step 8: Generate Structured Technical Proposal

Integrate all information and generate the final technical proposal based on the template.

**Template selection** (based on the tech stack selected by the user in Step 1.3):
- **Backend/Client**: Read `plugins/ttadk/core/resources/templates/brainstorm-output-template.md`
- **Frontend**: Read `plugins/ttadk/core/resources/templates/brainstorm-output-template-frontend.md`

**Output principles**:
- **IMPORTANT**: Do not add a `# Title` at the beginning of the document — the Lark document title will serve as the main title to avoid duplicate titles
- The document starts with a TTADK quote (refer to the `> Generated by ...` line in the template)
- Only output sections with actual changes; omit sections with no changes
- Change content: Only show change summary tables, no complete code needed
- Code changes: Only list key change points
- Call chain/interaction flow: Simplify to a single-line expression

**Output file**: `/specs/brainstorm/[feature_name]_brainstorm.md`

#### 8.1 Validate Mermaid Diagrams

If the generated document contains Mermaid code blocks (```mermaid```), you **must** perform **static syntax validation** on ALL Mermaid code blocks before proceeding:
   - **DO NOT use mermaid-cli** - it may not be installed and has version compatibility issues
   - For each `mermaid` code block, manually verify against this checklist:

   **Validation Checklist** (check each item):

   **Flowchart Validation**:
   - Uses `flowchart LR` or `flowchart TD` (not `graph`)
   - Node text with special chars is quoted: `A["Text with spaces"]`
   - Only allowed arrows: `-->`, `-.->`, `==>` (NO `-,->`, `--x`, `--o`)
   - Arrow labels are simple: `-->|Label|` (no `[]`, `<>`, or special chars in labels)
   - Subgraph syntax: `subgraph Name["Title"]` or `subgraph Name`

   **Sequence Diagram Validation**:
   - All `alt`/`opt`/`loop` blocks have matching `end`
   - **NO `box` syntax** (not supported in Mermaid 9.x)
   - Participant aliases don't contain special chars

   **State Diagram Validation**:
   - Uses `stateDiagram-v2` keyword
   - State names have no spaces (use aliases: `state "Name" as Alias`)

   **If issues found**:
   1. Fix the syntax error in the Mermaid code
   2. Re-write the corrected content to the file using Write tool
   3. Re-validate until all checks pass

   **Common Fixes**:
   - Unquoted text -> Add quotes: `A[Text]` -> `A["Text"]`
   - Wrong arrow -> Replace: `-,->` -> `-.->`, `--x` -> `-->`
   - Complex labels -> Simplify: remove `[]`, `<>`, `<br/>`
   - `box` syntax -> Remove entirely (use comments for grouping instead)

---

### Step 9: Lark Export and Feedback Collection

1. **Export to Lark document** (mandatory):
   - Use `mcp__lark-docs__import_markdown_to_lark` to import the generated proposal into Lark
   - Parameter settings:
     - `filePath`: Absolute path of the generated `brainstorm-output.md`
     - `title`: **IMPORTANT** - Generate a concise descriptive title that summarizes the core purpose of the feature:
       - Use the language matching the `preferred_language` setting (zh → Chinese, en → English)
       - Keep it short (preferably no more than 30 characters)
       - Focus on what the feature does, not technical implementation details
       - Examples: "User Auth Module Design", "Payment Gateway Integration", "Order State Machine Refactor"
       - Do not use the folder name directly — summarize the actual content
   - Obtain the Lark document URL
   - **Directly use the `open` command to open the Lark document link**:
     ```bash
     open "https://feishu.cn/docx/xxxxx"
     ```

2. **Guide the user to read and provide feedback**:
   ```markdown
   ## Proposal Generated

   **Lark Document**: [Link] (opened in browser)
   **Local File**: `brainstorm/[feature-name]/brainstorm-output.md`

   ---

   Please read the technical proposal in the Lark document, then let me know:
   1. Which parts are inaccurately described?
   2. Which change points are missing?
   3. Which sections need more detail?

   I will revise and refine based on your feedback.
   ```

3. **Handle user feedback**: Support multiple rounds of feedback iteration until the user is satisfied.

---

## Next Step Guidance

After the command execution is complete, provide next step guidance:

### Proposal Review
Guide the user to check whether the generated technical proposal meets expectations.

**If adjustments are needed**:
- Tell me directly what needs to be modified, and I will update the proposal
- Or re-execute `/adk:sdd:brainstorm` with additional information

### Next Steps
After the proposal is confirmed, you can:
1. Share the proposal with the team for review
2. Execute `/adk:sdd:specify` to create a formal feature specification based on the brainstorm output
3. Execute `/adk:sdd:ff` to quickly draft `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`
