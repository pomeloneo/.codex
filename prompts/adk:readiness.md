## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

Supported user input patterns:
- **No arguments**: Full 10-dimension scan
- **Specific dimensions**: e.g. `"only context and testing"` → scan only those dimensions
- **Output to file**: e.g. `"output to file"` → write report to `.ttadk/readiness-report.md`
- **Compare mode**: e.g. `"compare with last run"` → diff against previous report in `.ttadk/readiness-history/`
- **Target level**: e.g. `"target L3"` → only report improvements needed to reach L3

## Context

**Read context before Executing**:

1. **Language Setting**: Read `preferred_language` from `.ttadk/config.json` (default: 'en' if missing).
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the configured language for ALL outputs: 'en' → English, 'zh' → 中文. This applies to: report text, section headings, improvement suggestions, status messages, and error descriptions.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** create, modify, or delete any project files. This command only reads the repository and outputs a report. The sole exception is writing the report file when the user explicitly requests `"output to file"`.

## Evidence Model (avoid OSS-only false negatives)

The rubric measures **engineering capability**, not **GitHub layout**. A check is poorly designed if it can only pass via a single vendor path.

1. **Equivalence bundles (OR logic)** — For CI, ownership, MR/PR templates, dependency scanning, etc.: if **any** credible signal in the table below is present, treat the check as **PASS** (score accordingly). Do **not** FAIL solely because `.github/*` is missing.
2. **Repo vs platform** — Some controls (branch protection, required reviewers, org-level SCA) live on the **code platform**, not in the clone. If there is **no** file-based evidence, mark **`SKIP` (not verifiable from repo)** — **never FAIL** on absence of local files. List under report: "需在代码平台侧确认".
3. **Monorepo** — CI/owners/templates may live in a **parent** or **shared** config path (e.g. repo root vs package). Prefer the **nearest applicable** config; if clearly inherited from monorepo root, PASS with note `inherited from monorepo root`.
4. **Scoring** — For any row marked **SKIP**, exclude that row from **both** pass count and total for level pass-rate math (same as other SKIP rules).

### Common equivalence signals (non-exhaustive)

| Capability | Accept if any of these exist (or documented in README / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / AI instruction files) |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CI / pipeline | `.codebase/pipelines/*` (ByteDance Codebase CI YAML), `.github/workflows/*`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.circleci/*`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `build.sh` + CI doc, `ci.yml` / `*.pipeline.yml`, monorepo `**/ci/*`, Bazel/Gradle enterprise patterns with **documented** pipeline entry |
| Test in CI | Explicit test step in above, or `Makefile`/npm scripts used by documented pipeline |
| CODEOWNERS / ownership | `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS`, `CODEOWNERS` (root), `OWNERS` (e.g. Chromium-style), `.codeowners`, internal `**/OWNERS` or ownership doc **linking to platform** |
| MR/PR template | `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*`, `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/*`, `docs/*merge*request*template*`, template section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| Issue template | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`, `.gitlab/issue_templates/*`, or documented "use internal issue tracker" → **SKIP** issue-template row with note |
| Dependency / supply-chain scan | `dependabot.yml`, Renovate, Snyk, `dependency-check`, `osv-scanner`, `npm audit` / `go mod` audit in CI, **internal SCA** job names in pipeline YAML, documented mandatory org pipeline |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Identify Project Meta-Information

Scan the repository root to detect:

**1a. Tech Stack Detection** — Check for these files (batch into minimal tool calls):

| Signal Files | Tech Stack |
|---|---|
| `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` | Node.js / TypeScript |
| `package.json` + `next.config.*` | Next.js |
| `package.json` + `vite.config.*` | Vite |
| `go.mod` | Go |
| `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | Python |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java |

If multiple are present → Monorepo / multi-stack.

**1b. Repo Type** — Determine: single repo, monorepo, library/SDK, CLI tool, web app, backend service, etc.

**1c. Delivery context (heuristic)** — From repo signals only, set one tag for narrative (not a hard gate): `oss_github` (strong `.github/` usage), `gitlab_style` (`.gitlab-ci.yml` / `.gitlab/`), `enterprise_internal` (`.codebase/pipelines/` and/or internal CI docs, OWNERS, monorepo tooling, no OSS CI markers), `unknown`. Use this to phrase recommendations (e.g. avoid "enable Dependabot" when internal SCA is more accurate).

**1d. Load Previous Report** — Check `.ttadk/readiness-history/` for the most recent report. If found, load it for Grounding (delta comparison).

### Step 2 — Determine Skip Items

Based on detected tech stack, mark inapplicable checks as **SKIP**:

| Condition | Auto-SKIP |
|---|---|
| Go project | Formatter config (gofmt is built-in) |
| Rust project | Formatter config (rustfmt is built-in) |
| Go / Rust / Java | Type system check (language has built-in types) |
| Pure CLI tool | E2E tests |
| Library / SDK | One-click startup |
| Issue tracking fully external | Issue template row — if README/CONTRIBUTING states issues are **only** in an external system and no in-repo template applies → **SKIP** with note |
| Branch protection | **Always SKIP** (platform-side only; see Dimension 7 and Evidence Model) |

### Step 3 — Scan All 10 Dimensions

If `$ARGUMENTS` requests **only specific dimensions** (e.g. context and testing), run checks **only** for those dimensions; in Section A/E/F state clearly that the run is **partial** and overall **Level / Score** are **not** comparable to a full scan unless recalculated with full weights (or omit headline Level/Score and show per-dimension only).

For each **selected** dimension, execute the checks listed below. Use a **progressive scanning** strategy:
1. **Batch file-existence checks first** (low token cost) — list directories and check for specific files
2. **Then selectively read files** for quality/gradient checks (medium token cost)
3. **Early termination**: if a dimension is clearly 0/10 or 10/10 after existence checks, skip deep inspection

### Step 4 — Calculate Dual-Track Scores

**4a. Maturity Level (L1–L5)**

For each level L1 through L5, collect all check items tagged with that level:
- Let **applicable** = all items at that level that are **not** SKIP
- Pass rate = (count of **PASS** among applicable) / (count of **applicable**)
- Level N is unlocked if **all levels ≤ N** have pass rate ≥ **80%**
- Current Level = highest unlocked level

**4b. Weighted Percentage Score (0–100)**

```
Total Score = Σ (dimension_points / dimension_max_points × dimension_weight × 100)
```

For each dimension, `dimension_points` = sum of points from **non-SKIP** checks; `dimension_max_points` = sum of max points for those **same non-SKIP** checks (so platform-only SKIP rows do not deflate the score).

Where dimension weights are:
- Context Engineering: 15%
- Documentation: 12%
- Style & Validation: 10%
- Build System: 10%
- Testing: 12%
- Code Organization: 10%
- Security & Governance: 8%
- Version Control & Collaboration: 8%
- Code Complexity: 8%
- SDD Readiness: 7%

### Step 5 — Generate Report

Produce the report in the following structure. Use the language from `preferred_language`.

If `$ARGUMENTS` includes **target L*N*** (e.g. `target L3`): prioritize **Section D / G / H** on gaps that block reaching **L*N***; you may shorten lower-priority sections.

**Section A: Overview**

```
# AI Development Readiness Report

| Field      | Value                          |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Project    | <project-name>                 |
| Path       | <repo-path>                    |
| Tech Stack | <detected-stack>               |
| Repo Type  | <repo-type>                    |
| Date       | <today>                        |
| Level      | **L<N> (<level-name>)**        |
| Score      | **<score>/100**                |
| Pass Rate  | **<pass>/<total> criteria (<pct>%)** |
```

**Section B: Maturity Level Progress**

Show a progress bar for each level (L1–L5) with percentage and pass/fail indicator. Mark the current level and next target:

```
L1 Functional     ████████████ 100%  ✅
L2 Documented     █████████░░░  82%  ✅  ← Current
L3 Standardized   ██████░░░░░░  55%     ← Target (need N more)
L4 Optimized      ███░░░░░░░░░  28%
L5 Autonomous     █░░░░░░░░░░░   8%
```

**Section C: Strengths**

List top 3 highest-scoring dimensions with percentage and key findings.

**Section D: Opportunities**

List the specific checks needed to unlock the next level.

**Section E: Score Summary Table**

| # | Dimension | Score | Pass Rate | Key Finding |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Context Engineering | X/10 | X/X | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Section F: All Criteria (Detailed)**

For each dimension, list every check item with:
- ✓ / ✗ / — (pass / fail / skip) prefix
- Check name
- Points earned / max
- Brief explanation

Include **Quick Wins** under dimensions with easy improvements.

Example:
```
### Context Engineering 3/10 (2/5 pass)

✓ ttadk_configuration    1/2  .ttadk/ directory with config.json present
✗ ai_instruction_files   0/3  No CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, or AGENTS.md found
✓ mcp_configuration      1/2  .mcp.json exists with basic config
✗ ai_file_quality        0/2  No AI instruction files to evaluate
✗ ai_skills              0/1  No AI skill configuration found

**Quick Wins:**
- Create `CLAUDE.md` with project overview → run `/adk:sdd:constitution` (+3 pts)
```

**Section G: Top Recommendations**

Provide a prioritized table:

| # | Priority | Action | Impact | Effort | Level |
|---|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | ... | +X pts | time | → LN |

Priority levels:
- **CRITICAL**: Blocks current level unlock, highest ROI (> 10 pts impact)
- **HIGH**: Required for next level (5–10 pts)
- **MEDIUM**: Score improvement (2–5 pts)
- **LOW**: Future-facing, low urgency (< 2 pts)

Link improvement suggestions to ADK commands where applicable (e.g., "Run `/adk:sdd:constitution`").

**Section H: Roadmap to Next Level**

```
Current: **LN** → Target: **L(N+1)** (<level-name>)

### Must-fix (X items to unlock L(N+1)):
1. ✗ check_name — concrete remediation command or action
...

### Estimated effort: ~X hours
### Expected result: L(N+1) unlocked, score X → Y+
```

### Step 6 — Output

- **Default**: Print the full report to the **console only**. Do NOT automatically write any files.
- **If user requested "compare"** and a previous report exists in `.ttadk/readiness-history/`: Append a **Change Since Last Report** section showing score deltas and criteria status changes.

### Step 7 — Ask Whether to Save Report

After printing the report, **ask the user** whether they want to save the report to a file. Present the following information:

1. **File path**: `.ttadk/readiness-report.md` (latest report) + `.ttadk/readiness-history/readiness-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (timestamped copy)
2. **Purpose**: Explain that saving the report enables:
   - Future runs with `"compare with last run"` to track improvement over time
   - Historical trend analysis across multiple assessments
   - Sharing the report with team members

**Do NOT write any file unless the user explicitly confirms.** If the user's original `$ARGUMENTS` already contained `"output to file"`, treat that as confirmation and proceed to write without asking again.

## Token Efficiency Strategy

Follow these principles to minimize token consumption:

1. **Batch file-existence checks**: Use directory listing to check multiple files in one tool call
2. **Progressive depth**: Start with existence checks (cheap), then selectively read files for quality assessment
3. **Sample, don't exhaust**: For large repos, sample 10–20 representative files for quality/complexity checks
4. **Early termination**: If a dimension is clearly 0 or max after basic checks, skip deep inspection
5. **Avoid reading large files entirely**: For file size checks, use line counts; for quality checks, read only the first 50–100 lines

## Tech Stack Adaptation Table

Adapt checks based on detected tech stack:

| Check | Node.js/TS | Go | Python | Java | Rust |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type system | tsconfig strict | Built-in (SKIP) | mypy/pyright | Built-in (SKIP) | Built-in (SKIP) |
| Package manager | package.json | go.mod | pyproject.toml | pom.xml | Cargo.toml |
| Lock file | package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml | go.sum | poetry.lock / uv.lock | — (SKIP) | Cargo.lock |
| Linter | ESLint | golangci-lint | ruff / flake8 | checkstyle / spotbugs | clippy |
| Test framework | Jest / Vitest | go test | pytest | JUnit | cargo test |
| Formatter | Prettier | gofmt (SKIP) | black / ruff format | google-java-format | rustfmt (SKIP) |
| Pre-commit | Husky / lint-staged | pre-commit | pre-commit | — | — |

## Next Step Guidance

After outputting the report, provide next-step guidance:

### If Level < L2:
- **Priority**: Run `/adk:sdd:constitution` to create AI instruction files and project context
- Ensure basic build/test infrastructure is in place

### If Level = L2, targeting L3:
- Focus on the **Must-fix** items in the Roadmap section
- Typically: pre-commit hooks, integration tests, **MR/PR 描述规范**（模板或 CONTRIBUTING 约定）, **依赖/供应链扫描**（仓库内配置或平台流水线，按 Evidence Model 判断）

### If Level = L3, targeting L4:
- **Priority**: Run `/adk:sdd:constitution` to refine project principles
- Initialize specs/ directory with `/adk:sdd:specify`, or use `/adk:sdd:ff` for the fast-forward flow
- Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline

### If Level ≥ L4:
- Focus on autonomous operation capabilities
- Enhance observability and monitoring
- Consider running readiness periodically to track trends

### Re-assessment:
- After making improvements, re-run `/adk:readiness` to verify progress
- Use `"compare with last run"` to see the delta
