$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

If the given `$ARGUMENTS` contains a link, you need to read the content of the link (use lark-docs mcp if it's a lark doc) and replace the link with content.

## Context
**Read context before Executing**:
1. Language Setting
   - Read `preferred_language` from `.ttadk/config.json` (default: 'en' if missing). **IMPORTANT** **Use the configured language for ALL outputs: 'en' → English, 'zh' → 中文. This applies to: generated documents (specs, plans, tasks), interactive prompts, confirmations, status messages, and error descriptions.**

## Outline

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.

Note: This clarification workflow can run at ANY point during the design stage. It will synchronously update ALL existing design artifacts based on the clarifications.

**Core Principle**: Check which design-stage documents exist, and update ALL of them to maintain consistency.

**Design Stage Commands & Artifacts**:
- `/adk:sdd:specify` → `spec.md`
- `/adk:sdd:plan` → `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`
- `/adk:sdd:erd` → `technical-design.md` (Technical Design Document)
- `/adk:sdd:tasks` → `tasks.md`
- `/adk:sdt:ff` → `test/`

**Usage Examples**:
- Run after `/adk:sdd:specify` only → Updates only `spec.md`
- Run after `/adk:sdd:specify` + `/adk:sdd:plan` → Updates `spec.md` + all `/adk:sdd:plan` outputs
- Run after full design stage → Updates all design artifacts (spec, plan, erd, tasks)

Execution steps:

1. **Discover existing design artifacts:**
    - Run `node .ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/scripts/check-prerequisites.js --json --paths-only` from repo root **once**
    - Parse JSON payload fields: `FEATURE_DIR`, `FEATURE_SPEC`, `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS`
    - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/adk:sdd:specify` or verify feature directory environment.
    - **Explicitly check which design-stage documents exist** using Read tool for each file:
      * `FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` (REQUIRED - from `/adk:sdd:specify`)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/plan.md` (from `/adk:sdd:plan`)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/research.md` (from `/adk:sdd:plan` Phase 0)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/data-model.md` (from `/adk:sdd:plan` Phase 1)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/contracts/` directory (from `/adk:sdd:plan` Phase 1)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/quickstart.md` (from `/adk:sdd:plan` Phase 1)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md` (from `/adk:sdd:tasks`)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/technical-design.md` (from `/adk:sdd:erd`)
      * `FEATURE_DIR/test/` directory (from `/adk:sdt:ff`)
    - **Build and maintain a DISCOVERED_DOCS tracking list** with existence status for each document:
      ```
      DISCOVERED_DOCS = {
        "spec.md": { exists: true/false, path: "..." },
        "plan.md": { exists: true/false, path: "..." },
        "tasks.md": { exists: true/false, path: "..." },
        ...
      }
      ```
    - This list is **REQUIRED** for Step 6 and Step 9 - every existing document must be processed.

2. Load guiding principles and current spec:
   - Read `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` (fallback: `.ttadk/memory/constitution.md` for legacy projects) - consider these principles when evaluating clarification impact
   - **IF EXISTS**: Scan `docs/` for available knowledge assets (e.g., check `docs/arch/`, `docs/references/`, root-level `docs/*.md`). Load whichever files are relevant to the current task based on their filenames and contents — do not rely on a hardcoded list.
   - Load the current spec file
   - Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

    Functional Scope & Behavior:
    - Core user goals & success criteria
    - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
    - User roles / personas differentiation

    Domain & Data Model:
    - Entities, attributes, relationships
    - Identity & uniqueness rules
    - Lifecycle/state transitions
    - Data volume / scale assumptions

    Interaction & UX Flow:
    - Critical user journeys / sequences
    - Error/empty/loading states
    - Accessibility or localization notes

    Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
    - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
    - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
    - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
    - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
    - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
    - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

    Integration & External Dependencies:
    - External services/APIs and failure modes
    - Data import/export formats
    - Protocol/versioning assumptions

    Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
    - Negative scenarios
    - Rate limiting / throttling
    - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

    Constraints & Tradeoffs:
    - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
    - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

    Terminology & Consistency:
    - Canonical glossary terms
    - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

    Completion Signals:
    - Acceptance criteria testability
    - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

    Misc / Placeholders:
    - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
    - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

    For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
    - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
    - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:
    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.
    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
        * A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
        * A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.

4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‑choice questions render options as a Markdown table:

        | Option | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | A | <Option A description> |
        | B | <Option B description> |
        | C | <Option C description> | (add D/E as needed up to 5)
        | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) | (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate)

    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options), output a single line after the question: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words)`.
    - After the user answers:
        * Validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
        * If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
        * Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
        * All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
        * User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
        * You reach 5 asked questions.
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
        * Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
        * Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
        * Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
        * User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
        * Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
        * Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
        * Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
        * Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

5.1 **MANDATORY: After questioning loop ends (before reporting):**
    - ⚠️ **DO NOT proceed to Step 9 (reporting) without executing Step 6 (document synchronization)**
    - When user signals completion ("done", "good", "no more") or question quota reached:
      * First complete any pending spec.md integration from Step 5
      * Then **IMMEDIATELY proceed to Step 6** - this is NOT optional
    - Skipping Step 6 will result in inconsistent design artifacts

6. **Synchronously update all existing design-stage documents:**

    ⚠️ **THIS STEP IS MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP**

    - **BEFORE reporting completion, you MUST process ALL documents in DISCOVERED_DOCS from Step 1**
    - For each document in DISCOVERED_DOCS where `exists: true`:
      * **Analyze impact**: Determine if clarifications affect this document
      * **If affected**: Update the document with relevant changes
      * **If not affected**: Record "No changes needed" with specific reason (for Step 9 report)
    - **ONLY update documents that exist** - skip non-existent files.
    - Update documents in dependency order to maintain consistency:

    **A. Update `/adk:sdd:plan` outputs (if they exist):**

    **If `plan.md` exists:**
    - Read existing `plan.md` to understand current implementation approach.
    - Analyze spec.md clarifications that impact technical design (data model, entities, non-functional requirements, integrations).
    - Update affected sections:
      * Technical Context: Update tech stack if clarifications reveal new requirements
      * Architecture: Adjust structure if functional scope changed
      * User Stories: Ensure they still align with the clarified spec
      * Data Storage/Model: Update if data requirements clarified
    - Save updated plan.md.

    **If `research.md` exists:**
    - Read existing `research.md`.
    - If clarifications resolve NEEDS CLARIFICATION items that were deferred to research:
      * Add new decisions based on clarifications
      * Update rationale if clarifications change technical choices
      * Mark resolved items from spec clarification
    - Save updated research.md.

    **If `data-model.md` exists:**
    - Read existing `data-model.md`.
    - Analyze clarifications that impact data model (entities, attributes, relationships, constraints).
    - Update data-model.md:
      * Add/modify entities based on clarified requirements
      * Update field definitions and types
      * Adjust relationships if functional scope changed
      * Update validation rules from clarified constraints
    - Save updated data-model.md.

    **If `contracts/` directory exists:**
    - List files in contracts/ directory.
    - If clarifications affect API behavior (new endpoints, changed request/response, new error cases):
      * Update relevant OpenAPI/GraphQL schema files
      * Add new endpoints if functional requirements expanded
      * Modify existing endpoint definitions for clarified behavior
    - Save updated contract files.

    **If `quickstart.md` exists:**
    - Read existing `quickstart.md`.
    - If clarifications change user scenarios or core flows:
      * Update quickstart examples to reflect clarified behavior
      * Add new steps if functional requirements expanded
    - Save updated quickstart.md.

    **B. Update `/adk:sdd:erd` outputs (if they exist):**

    **If `technical-design.md` exists:**
    - Read existing `technical-design.md` to understand current technical design (architecture, data model, interfaces, etc.).
    - Check if clarifications impact technical design (architecture changes, data model, API definitions, schema changes).
    - If impacted:
      * Update architecture diagrams and descriptions
      * Update entity definitions and relationships in ER diagrams
      * Update interface definitions (API/RPC)
      * Update schema definitions (DB/MQ/Cache)
      * Ensure all Mermaid diagrams follow correct syntax
    - Save updated technical-design.md.

    **C. Update `/adk:sdd:tasks` outputs (if they exist):**

    **If `tasks.md` exists:** ← **THIS IS MANDATORY IF tasks.md EXISTS**
    - Read existing `tasks.md` to understand current task breakdown.
    - Treat `- [x]` / `- [X]` tasks as implementation history that is already claimed complete.
    - **Do not silently reopen completed tasks** just because a clarification changes future work.
    - **ALWAYS perform impact analysis** - do not skip this step:
      * Review each clarification Q&A from this session
      * Map each clarification to potentially affected task categories
    - **Update triggers** (if ANY of these apply, tasks.md MUST be updated):
      * Functional requirement clarified → Review and update affected user story tasks
      * New edge case identified → Add validation/error handling tasks
      * Data model clarified → Update model/migration/schema tasks
      * Non-functional requirement added/changed → Add corresponding performance/security tasks
      * Scope changed (added/removed features) → Add/remove/reorder tasks accordingly
      * New integration point identified → Add integration tasks
    - **Completed-task preservation rule:**
      * If a clarification adds net-new work after a completed task, keep the completed task checked and append new `- [ ]` follow-up tasks for the delta.
      * If a clarification tightens acceptance criteria for work not yet implemented, update the relevant incomplete task directly.
      * Do not rewrite the requirement wording of a completed task to match post-implementation clarifications while leaving it checked.
      * If a completed task no longer matches the clarified requirement, keep its original completed wording as implementation history and add a new `- [ ]` follow-up or replacement task for the clarified behavior. Only reopen the task if you explicitly convert it back to `- [ ]` from `- [x]`.
      * Only remove a completed task if it was duplicated or entered in error, and explicitly document that reason in the completion report.
    - Prefer additive task updates over rewriting completed history. The default pattern is: keep completed work immutable, then model clarification fallout as newly added pending tasks.
    - Update tasks to align with clarified spec and updated plan.
    - **If no updates needed**: Document specific reason why each clarification does NOT affect tasks
      (e.g., "Clarification Q1 only affects UI text, no task changes needed")
    - Save updated tasks.md.

    **D. Update `/adk:sdt:ff` outputs (if they exist):**

    **If `test/` directory exists:**
    - Read existing `test/` directory to understand current test design files (case.md, task.md).
    - **Update triggers** (if ANY of these apply, test design MUST be updated):
      * Functional requirement clarified → test cases covering that requirement need review
      * New edge case or error handling identified → new test scenarios needed
      * Data model or API definition changed → test data and assertions need alignment
      * Acceptance criteria modified → corresponding verification steps must update
      * Non-functional requirement added/changed → performance/security test cases may be affected
    - If impacted:
      * Run `/adk:sdt:clarify` to update test design files
      * **Suppress** the "Next Step Guidance" section produced by `/adk:sdt:clarify`; do not display it to the user.
    - **If no updates needed**: Document specific reason why each clarification does NOT affect test design
      (e.g., "Clarification Q1 only affects UI text, no test design changes needed")

7. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
    - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
    - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.
    - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
    - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
    - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
    - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.
    - If downstream documents were updated, ensure consistency across all documents.

    **Cross-document consistency checks (REQUIRED):**
    - For each document in DISCOVERED_DOCS where `exists: true`:
      * Verify it was either **updated** OR **explicitly marked as "no changes needed" with reason**
    - **If tasks.md exists AND any clarification touched these areas, tasks.md MUST reflect changes:**
      * Functional requirements → task breakdown must align
      * Edge cases or error handling → corresponding validation tasks must exist
      * Data model changes → model/migration tasks must be updated
      * Non-functional requirements → performance/security tasks must exist
    - **If affected tasks were already completed, validation expects additive follow-up tasks instead of reverting `- [x]` to `- [ ]` by default.**
    - **FAIL validation if:**
      * Any existing document was neither updated nor explicitly reviewed
      * tasks.md exists but was skipped without documented justification for each clarification

8. Write all updated documents back to their respective paths.

9. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
    - Number of questions asked & answered.
    - Path to updated spec.

    **Document Update Summary (REQUIRED for each document in DISCOVERED_DOCS):**

    | Document | Exists | Updated | Sections Changed | Reason if Not Updated |
    |----------|--------|---------|------------------|----------------------|
    | spec.md  | ✓/✗    | ✓/✗     | (list sections)  | (reason or "-")      |
    | plan.md  | ✓/✗    | ✓/✗     | (list sections)  | (reason or "-")      |
    | research.md | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗     | (list sections)  | (reason or "-")      |
    | data-model.md | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗   | (list sections)  | (reason or "-")      |
    | contracts/ | ✓/✗   | ✓/✗     | (list files)     | (reason or "-")      |
    | quickstart.md | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗   | (list sections)  | (reason or "-")      |
    | technical-design.md | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | (list sections) | (reason or "-")    |
    | tasks.md | ✓/✗    | ✓/✗     | (list tasks/phases) | (reason or "-")   |
    | test/ | ✓/✗   | ✓/✗     | (list files)     | (reason or "-")      |

    - **If any document exists but was NOT updated, you MUST provide explicit reasoning in the table**
    - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
    - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/adk:sdd:plan` or `/adk:sdd:erd` or `/adk:sdd:tasks` or run `/adk:sdd:clarify` again.
    - Suggested next command.

Behavior rules:
- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/adk:sdd:specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed") - **but ALWAYS execute Step 6 before reporting**.
- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

**CRITICAL - Cross-document update rules:**
- **If tasks.md exists, you MUST either:**
  1. Update it based on clarifications, OR
  2. Explicitly state in the Document Update Summary why no updates were needed (with specific analysis per clarification)
- **When updating tasks.md, preserve completed-task history by default; represent clarification-induced rework as newly added pending tasks unless the original completed entry was erroneous.**
- **Never report completion without having processed ALL existing design documents**
- **Document skips are NOT allowed** - every document in DISCOVERED_DOCS where `exists: true` must be analyzed
- Early termination by user does NOT exempt you from Step 6 document synchronization

Context for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS

## Next Step Guidance

After executing this command, provide next-step guidance to user:

### Step 1 - Confirmation
Guide user to verify the updated documents are correct.

**If needs adjustment**: Run `/adk:sdd:clarify [feedback]` again to continue refining the documents.

### Step 2 - Next Step Recommendation
Once documents are confirmed and satisfactory, recommend the next command based on existing documents:

- If only `spec.md` exists → Execute `/adk:sdd:plan`
- If `spec.md` + `plan.md` exist but no `tasks.md` → Execute `/adk:sdd:tasks`
- If all documents exist → Execute `/adk:sdd:implement`
- If unclear which stage the user is in → Do not make explicit recommendation, let user decide
