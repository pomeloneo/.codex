## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

If the given `$ARGUMENTS` contains a link, you need to read the content of the link. For lark/feishu doc URLs, export it via lark-docs MCP (`mcp__lark-docs__export_lark_doc_markdown`), then read the exported markdown content to understand the feedback context.

If `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly provides a `FEATURE_DIR` value, or clearly provides a feature-directory path, you **MUST**
treat it as the highest-priority target feature input. Reuse that exact value when invoking prerequisite scripts, and do
not ask the user to choose a different feature unless the provided path is invalid or ambiguous.

## Context
**Read context before Executing**:
1. Language Setting
   - Read `preferred_language` from `.ttadk/config.json` (default: 'en' if missing). **IMPORTANT** **Use the configured language for ALL outputs: 'en' → English, 'zh' → 中文. This applies to: generated documents (specs, plans, tasks), interactive prompts, confirmations, status messages, and error descriptions.**

## Outline

Goal: Interactively review and modify test cases in `test/case.md` based on user feedback and code implementation comparison. Operates in a brainstorm-style multi-round dialogue, providing recommended modification options for each review point.

### Step 1: Pre-check

1. Read `test/case.md` at the repository root.
   - If `test/case.md` does not exist, **STOP** and display error: "test/case.md not found. Please run `/adk:sdt:ff` first to generate test cases."
2. Read `test/task.md ` at the repository root.
   - If `test/task.md` does not exist, **STOP** and display error: "test/task.md not found. Please run `/adk:sdt:ff` first to generate test execution tasks."
3. Run `node .ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/scripts/check-prerequisites.js --json` from repo root.
4. Parse the JSON output to get `FEATURE_DIR`.

### Step 2: Load Context

1. **REQUIRED**: Read `test/case.md` — the test cases to review.
2. **REQUIRED**: Read `FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` — for requirement context.
3. **Explore codebase**: Use `Grep` and `Glob` tools to search for relevant code implementations mentioned in the test cases (API endpoints, functions, components, etc.).

### Step 3: Parse User Feedback

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is not empty:**
1. Parse the user feedback to extract:
   - **TC-ID** (if mentioned): e.g., "TC-001", "TC-003"
   - **Feedback content**: the specific issue or concern
2. Locate the referenced test case(s) in `test/case.md`.
3. Proceed to Step 4 with the identified test case(s).

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:**
1. Start with a full scan mode — analyze all test cases for potential issues.
2. Proceed to Step 5 directly.

### Step 4: Display Test Case Analysis

For each test case identified from user feedback (or from scan):

1. **Display the current test case**: Show the full content.
2. **Compare with code implementation**:
   - Use `Grep` to search for relevant API routes, function names, or component references.
   - Use `Read` to examine the actual code implementation.
   - Identify discrepancies between test expectations and actual code behavior.
3. **Present analysis results**:
   - Highlight differences between test case assumptions and code reality.
   - Mark specific Given/When/Then items that may be incorrect or outdated.

### Step 5: Evaluate Validity and Provide Modification Options

For each reviewed test case:

**If the test case is NOT reasonable (has issues):**

1. Use `AskUserQuestion` to present 2-3 modification options:
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: The best-practice fix with explanation.
   - **Option B**: An alternative approach with different trade-offs.
   - **Option C** (optional): A minimal change option.

2. After user selects an option:
   - Use `Edit` tool to immediately update the corresponding test case in `test/case.md`.
   - Confirm the change was applied successfully.

**If the test case IS reasonable (no issues found):**

1. Display: "✓ TC-XXX: Test case is valid, no modification needed"
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Continue reviewing the next test case?"
   - Yes → Continue to next test case
   - No → Proceed to Step 6

### Step 6: Proactively Identify Other Suspicious Test Cases

After completing user-specified reviews:

1. Scan remaining test cases in `test/case.md` that were NOT explicitly reviewed.
2. For each case, check:
   - Are the Given conditions still valid based on current code?
   - Do the When steps match actual API/UI flows?
   - Are the Then expectations consistent with code behavior?
3. If suspicious cases are found:
   - Present each suspicious case with analysis.
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask if the user wants to fix it.
   - Apply fixes using the same Step 5 workflow.
4. If no suspicious cases found:
   - Display: "No other suspicious test cases found."

### Step 7: Report Change Summary

Display a summary of all changes made during this session:

```
## Change Summary

### Modified Test Cases
| TC-ID | Modification | Modification Type |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| TC-001 | Updated parameters | User feedback |
| TC-005 | Corrected expected API result | Proactive identification |

### Unmodified Test Cases
- TC-002, TC-003, TC-004: Review passed, no modification needed

### Statistics
- Test cases reviewed: N
- Test cases modified: M
- Proactively identified and fixed: K
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|---------|
| test/case.md does not exist | Prompt user to run `/adk:sdt:ff` first |
| User-specified TC-ID does not exist | Display "TC-XXX not found in case.md" and list available TC-IDs |
| User cancels operation | Preserve already-applied modifications and output current change summary |
| Related code files not found | Warn "Related code implementation not found, reviewing based on spec.md only" |

## Next Step Guidance

After executing this command:

### Step 1 - Confirmation
Review the updated `test/case.md` to verify all modifications are correct.

**If needs further adjustment**: Run `/adk:sdt:clarify [feedback]` again with additional feedback.

### Step 2 - Next Step Recommendation
Once test cases are finalized:

**Execute Tests**: Execute `/adk:sdt:implement` to run tests. Skill selection is resolved automatically (domain/profile based) and should be invisible to normal users.
