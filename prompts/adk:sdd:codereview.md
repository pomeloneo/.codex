description: Structured code review using tiered reviewer personas, confidence-gated findings, and a merge/dedup pipeline. Use after implementation and before commit or Bits-Code MR creation.

---

# Code Review

Reviews code changes using dynamically selected reviewer personas. Spawns parallel sub-agents that return structured JSON, then merges and deduplicates findings into a single report.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Context
**Read context before Executing**:

1. Language Setting
   - Read `preferred_language` from `.ttadk/config.json` (default: 'en' if missing). **IMPORTANT** **Use the configured language for ALL outputs: 'en' → English, 'zh' → 中文. This applies to: review findings, confirmations, status messages, summaries, and error descriptions.**

2. Knowledge Asset Loading (if available):
   - **IF EXISTS**: Scan `docs/` for available knowledge assets (e.g., check `docs/arch/`, `docs/references/`, root-level `docs/*.md`). Load whichever files are relevant to the current task based on their filenames and contents — do not rely on a hardcoded list.

## Shared Workflow

This file is the canonical execution spec for that workflow.

Runtime assets for review must come from `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/`.

## Position In SDD

- `/adk:sdd:analyze` reviews `spec.md` / `plan.md` / `tasks.md` artifacts before coding.
- `/adk:sdd:implement` auto-simplifies after each phase completion.
- `/adk:sdd:codereview` reviews code changes after `/adk:sdd:implement` and before `/adk:commit`.

Recommended sequence:

```text
/adk:sdd:implement → /adk:sdd:codereview → /adk:commit
```

**Note**: Code quality issues (duplication, unnecessary complexity) are already addressed by the built-in simplify step. Codereview should focus on correctness, security, testing, and architectural risks.

## When to Use

- Before creating a Bits-Code MR
- After completing a task during iterative implementation
- When feedback is needed on code changes
- Can run as a read-only or autofix review step inside larger workflows

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the following optional tokens. Strip each recognized token before interpreting the remainder as the Bits-Code MR number, URL, or branch name.

| Token | Example | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `mode:autofix` | `mode:autofix` | Select autofix mode |
| `mode:report-only` | `mode:report-only` | Select report-only mode |
| `mode:headless` | `mode:headless` | Select headless mode for programmatic callers |
| `base:<sha-or-ref>` | `base:abc1234` or `base:origin/main` | Skip scope detection and use this diff base directly |
| `plan:<path>` | `plan:specs/20260408-foo/plan.md` | Load this plan for requirements verification |

All tokens are optional.

**Conflicting mode flags:** If multiple mode tokens appear in arguments, stop and do not dispatch agents. If `mode:headless` is one of the conflicting tokens, emit: `Review failed (headless mode). Reason: conflicting mode flags — <mode_a> and <mode_b> cannot be combined.` Otherwise emit: `Review failed. Reason: conflicting mode flags — <mode_a> and <mode_b> cannot be combined.`

## Mode Detection

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **Interactive** (default) | No mode token present | Review, apply `safe_auto` fixes automatically, present findings, and optionally continue into next steps |
| **Autofix** | `mode:autofix` | No user interaction. Apply only policy-allowed `safe_auto` fixes, re-review in bounded rounds, write a run artifact |
| **Report-only** | `mode:report-only` | Strictly read-only. Review and report only |
| **Headless** | `mode:headless` | Programmatic mode. Apply `safe_auto` fixes silently in a single pass, return the rest as structured output, write a run artifact, and end with `Review complete` |

### Autofix mode rules

- Skip all user questions after scope is established.
- Apply only `safe_auto -> review-fixer` findings.
- Write a run artifact under `codereview/<run-id>/` summarizing findings, applied fixes, residual actionable work, and advisory outputs.
- Create durable todo files only for unresolved actionable findings whose final owner is `downstream-resolver`.
- Never commit, push, or create a Bits-Code MR from autofix mode.

### Report-only mode rules

- Skip all user questions.
- Never edit files or externalize work.
- Do not write `codereview/<run-id>/`, do not create todo files, and do not commit, push, or create a Bits-Code MR.
- Do not switch the shared checkout. If the caller passes an explicit Bits-Code MR or branch target, `mode:report-only` must run in an isolated checkout/worktree or stop.

### Headless mode rules

- Skip all user questions.
- Require a determinable diff scope.
- Apply only `safe_auto -> review-fixer` findings in a single pass.
- Return all non-auto findings as structured text output using the headless output envelope.
- Write a run artifact under `codereview/<run-id>/`.
- Do not create todo files.
- Do not switch the shared checkout for MR or branch review; stop with a clear error instead.
- Never commit, push, or create a Bits-Code MR from headless mode.
- End with `Review complete` as the terminal signal.

## Severity Scale

All reviewers use `P0-P3`:

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **P0** | Critical breakage, exploitable vulnerability, data loss/corruption | Must fix before merge |
| **P1** | High-impact defect likely hit in normal usage, breaking contract | Should fix |
| **P2** | Moderate issue with meaningful downside | Fix if straightforward |
| **P3** | Low-impact, narrow scope, minor improvement | User's discretion |

## Action Routing

| `autofix_class` | Default owner | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| `safe_auto` | `review-fixer` | Local, deterministic fix suitable for in-skill fixing |
| `gated_auto` | `downstream-resolver` or `human` | Concrete fix exists, but changes behavior, contracts, permissions, or another sensitive boundary |
| `manual` | `downstream-resolver` or `human` | Actionable work that should be handed off rather than fixed in-skill |
| `advisory` | `human` or `release` | Report-only output such as learnings, rollout notes, or residual risk |

Routing rules:

- Synthesis owns the final route.
- Choose the more conservative route on disagreement.
- Only `safe_auto -> review-fixer` enters the in-skill fixer queue automatically.
- `requires_verification: true` means a fix is not complete without targeted tests, focused re-review, or operational validation.

## Reviewers

17 reviewer personas in layered conditionals, plus TTADK review agents. See the persona catalog included below for the full catalog.

**Availability note:** Reviewer names in the persona catalog are aligned to currently available Codex reviewer skills in this environment rather than the original `compound-engineering:*` namespaced agent IDs.

## Protected Artifacts

The following paths are TTADK/SDD artifacts and must never be flagged for deletion, removal, or gitignore by any reviewer:

- `docs/brainstorms/*`
- `docs/plans/*.md`
- `docs/solutions/*.md`
- `specs/*/spec.md`
- `specs/*/plan.md`
- `specs/*/tasks.md`
- `specs/*/research.md`
- `specs/*/data-model.md`
- `specs/*/technical-design.md`
- `specs/*/contracts/*`
- `specs/*/quickstart.md`

If a reviewer flags any file in these directories for cleanup or removal, discard that finding during synthesis.

## How to Run

### Stage 1: Determine scope

Compute the diff range, file list, and diff. Minimize permission prompts by combining into as few commands as possible.

**If `base:` argument is provided (fast path):**

```
BASE_ARG="{base_arg}"
BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD "$BASE_ARG" 2>/dev/null) || BASE="$BASE_ARG"
echo "BASE:$BASE" && echo "FILES:" && git diff --name-only $BASE && echo "DIFF:" && git diff -U10 $BASE && echo "UNTRACKED:" && git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Do not combine `base:` with a Bits-Code MR number or branch target. If both are present, stop with: `Cannot use base: with a Bits-Code MR number or branch target — base: implies the current checkout is already the correct branch.`

**If a Bits-Code MR number or URL is provided:**

If `mode:report-only` or `mode:headless` is active, do **not** switch the shared checkout. For `mode:report-only`, stop and report that the review must run from an isolated checkout/worktree for that Bits-Code MR. For `mode:headless`, emit `Review failed (headless mode). Reason: cannot switch shared checkout. Re-invoke with base:<ref> to review the current checkout, or run from an isolated worktree.`

If checkout switching is allowed:

1. Verify the worktree is clean first with `git status --porcelain`
2. Resolve the MR reference using Bits-Code conventions:
   - MR URL: parse `https://code.byted.org/<repo-path>/-/merge_request/<number>` into `<repo-path>` and `<number>`
   - MR number only: derive `<repo-path>` from `git remote get-url origin`
3. Fetch MR metadata from Bits-Code / Codebase. Preferred protocol:

```javascript
GetMergeRequest({
  RepoId: "<repo-path>",
  Number: <mr-number>
})
```

   If the runtime does not expose Codebase MCP directly, use the equivalent GDPA codebase capability with the same `repo_id` / `number` inputs.
4. From the MR payload, extract at minimum:
   - `source_branch`
   - `target_branch`
   - target repo path / repo id
   - title
   - description/body
   - URL
5. Export the review-base context before resolving scope:

```text
REVIEW_BASE_BRANCH=<target_branch>
REVIEW_BASE_REPO=<target-repo-path>
```

6. Check out the MR source branch locally. If the branch is not present locally, fetch the MR source remote/branch first.
7. Build the `<mr-context>` payload passed to reviewers from the fetched Bits-Code MR metadata. Use `mr_metadata` as the template variable name.
8. Resolve the review base with `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/resolve-base.sh`
9. Produce local diff scope against the resolved merge-base

Do not fall back to `git diff HEAD` if the Bits-Code MR base cannot be resolved.

**MR metadata contract:** when MR metadata is available, normalize it into this shape before passing it into the review skill or subagent template:

```json
{
  "repo": "<repo-path>",
  "number": 123,
  "url": "https://code.byted.org/<repo-path>/-/merge_request/123",
  "title": "<mr-title>",
  "body": "<mr-description>",
  "source_branch": "<source-branch>",
  "target_branch": "<target-branch>",
  "target_repo": "<target-repo-path>"
}
```

The orchestrator should serialize that normalized object into the `<mr-context>` block so reviewer prompts can consume one stable schema regardless of whether the runtime used Codebase MCP or GDPA codebase under the hood.

**If a branch name is provided:**

If `mode:report-only` or `mode:headless` is active, do **not** switch the shared checkout. For `mode:report-only`, stop and report that the review must run from an isolated checkout/worktree for that branch. For `mode:headless`, emit `Review failed (headless mode). Reason: cannot switch shared checkout. Re-invoke with base:<ref> to review the current checkout, or run from an isolated worktree.`

If checkout switching is allowed:

1. Verify the worktree is clean first with `git status --porcelain`
2. `git checkout <branch>`
3. Resolve the review base using `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/resolve-base.sh`
4. Produce the diff against that base

**If no argument is provided:**

Detect the review base branch and compute the merge-base using `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/resolve-base.sh`, then produce:

```
echo "BASE:$BASE" && echo "FILES:" && git diff --name-only $BASE && echo "DIFF:" && git diff -U10 $BASE && echo "UNTRACKED:" && git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

If the runtime can query Bits-Code / Codebase, first attempt MR auto-detection for the current branch:

```javascript
ListMergeRequests({
  RepoId: "<repo-path-from-origin>",
  SourceBranch: "<current-branch>",
  Status: "open"
})
```

If exactly one open Bits-Code MR matches the current branch, treat the run as Bits-Code MR mode and use the MR protocol above. Otherwise stay in standalone branch mode.

**Untracked file handling:** Always inspect `UNTRACKED:`. If non-empty, tell the user which files are excluded. In `mode:headless` or `mode:autofix`, proceed with tracked changes only and note the excluded untracked files in Coverage.

**Submodule handling:** After computing the main diff, collect submodule diffs as a separate step:

1. Parse `resolve-base.sh` output for `SUBMODULE:<path>:BASE:<sha>` and `SUBMODULE:<path>:DIRTY:true` lines
2. For each resolved submodule, collect:
   - **Committed changes** (against the submodule's own base): `cd <path> && git diff --name-only <sub_base>` for file list, `git diff -U10 <sub_base>` for diff
   - **Uncommitted changes** (if `DIRTY:true`): `cd <path> && git diff && git diff --cached` for unstaged + staged changes
   - **Untracked files** (if `DIRTY:true`): `cd <path> && git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`
3. Prefix each submodule section with `--- SUBMODULE: <path> (base: <sub_base>) ---` so reviewers can distinguish submodule diffs from the parent repo diff
4. Assemble all submodule diffs into the `{submodule_diffs}` template variable; if no submodules changed, set it to `(none)`

This step applies to all four Stage 1 paths (base:, MR, branch, no-arg).

### Stage 2: Intent discovery

Understand what the change is trying to accomplish. The source of intent depends on which Stage 1 path was taken.

- Bits-Code MR mode: use MR title, body, linked issues, and commit messages if the MR body is sparse.
- Branch mode: inspect commit messages relative to the resolved base.
- Standalone mode: inspect current branch name and commits since the resolved base.

Write a 2-3 line intent summary and pass it to every reviewer.

Example:

```text
Intent: Simplify review orchestration by extracting a dedicated /adk:sdd:codereview
command from the original CE workflow. Must not conflate design-artifact analysis
with code review, and should remain safe before /adk:commit.
```

When intent is ambiguous:

- Interactive mode: ask one blocking question before spawning reviewers.
- Autofix/report-only/headless modes: infer intent conservatively and note the uncertainty in Coverage.

### Stage 2b: Plan discovery (requirements verification)

Locate the plan document so Stage 6 can verify requirements completeness. Check these sources in priority order:

1. `plan:` argument
2. Bits-Code MR body references to `specs/*/plan.md` or `docs/plans/*.md`
3. Auto-discovery from branch keywords

Record the confidence as:

- `plan_source: explicit`
- `plan_source: inferred`

If a plan is found, read its requirements and implementation units for Stage 6. Do not block the review if no plan is found; requirements verification is additive, not mandatory.

### Stage 3: Select reviewers

Read the diff and file list from Stage 1. The always-on personas and always-on TTADK agents are automatic. For each cross-cutting and stack-specific conditional persona in the persona catalog, decide whether the diff warrants it.

`previous-comments` is Bits-Code MR-only.

Announce the team before spawning. This is progress reporting, not a blocking confirmation.

### Stage 3b: Discover project standards paths

Before spawning sub-agents, find the file paths of all relevant `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files that govern the changed files. Pass those path lists to the `project-standards` persona inside a `<standards-paths>` block.

### Stage 4: Spawn sub-agents

#### Reviewer prompt source

After selecting reviewers from `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/persona-catalog.md`, load each reviewer's prompt from:

```text
.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/reviewers/<reviewer-name>.md
```

Use that file content as the reviewer persona prompt.

Do **not** read reviewer prompts from unrelated skill directories. Use only the dedicated review skill package resources under `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/`.

Spawn each selected persona reviewer as a parallel sub-agent using the subagent template included below. Each persona sub-agent receives:

1. Their persona prompt content loaded from `.ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/codereview/reviewers/<reviewer-name>.md`
2. Shared diff-scope rules
3. The JSON output contract
4. Bits-Code MR metadata when reviewing a Bits-Code MR
5. Review context: intent summary, file list, diff
6. For `project-standards` only: standards-paths block
7. Submodule diffs (when submodule pointers changed in the diff)

Persona sub-agents are read-only. They may use non-mutating inspection commands but must not edit files, change branches, commit, push, or mutate repository state.

Each persona sub-agent returns JSON matching the findings schema.

Always-on TTADK agents and migration-specific conditional agents are also dispatched with the same review context bundle and synthesized separately in Stage 6.

For the always-on and TTADK conditional agents, pass:

- entry mode
- Bits-Code MR metadata when available
- intent summary
- review base branch when known
- `BASE:` marker
- file list
- diff
- `UNTRACKED:` scope notes
- submodule diffs (`SUBMODULE_DIFFS:` section)

### Stage 5: Merge findings

1. **Validate.** Check each output against the schema. Drop malformed findings and record the drop count.
2. **Confidence gate.** Suppress findings below `0.60`, except `P0` findings at `0.50+`. Record the suppressed count.
3. **Deduplicate.** Use a fingerprint based on normalized file path + nearby line bucket (`+/-3`) + normalized title.
4. **Cross-reviewer agreement.** Boost confidence by `0.10` when multiple independent reviewers flag the same issue, capped at `1.0`.
5. **Separate pre-existing.** Pull out findings with `pre_existing: true` into a separate list.
6. **Resolve disagreements.** When reviewers disagree on severity, `autofix_class`, or owner for the same region, keep the more conservative route and preserve the disagreement in evidence.
7. **Normalize routing.** Synthesis sets final `autofix_class`, `owner`, and `requires_verification`.
8. **Partition the work.** Build:
   - in-skill fixer queue
   - residual actionable queue
   - report-only queue
9. **Sort.** Order by severity, confidence, file path, line number.
10. **Collect coverage data.** Union residual risks and testing gaps.
11. **Preserve TTADK agent artifacts.** Do not drop unstructured outputs from learnings, agent-native, schema-drift, or deployment-verification agents.

### Stage 6: Synthesize and present

Assemble the final report using **pipe-delimited markdown tables for findings** from the review output template included below. The table format is mandatory in interactive mode.

Sections:

1. Header: scope, intent, mode, reviewer team with justifications
2. Findings grouped by severity (`### P0 -- Critical`, `### P1 -- High`, `### P2 -- Moderate`, `### P3 -- Low`)
3. Requirements Completeness if a plan was found
4. Applied Fixes when a fix phase ran
5. Residual Actionable Work
6. Pre-existing issues
7. Learnings & Past Solutions
8. Agent-Native Gaps
9. Schema Drift Check
10. Deployment Notes
11. Coverage
12. Verdict

Do not include time estimates.

**Format verification:** Before delivering the report, verify the findings sections use pipe-delimited markdown table rows. If you catch yourself rendering findings as prose blocks or bullets, reformat into tables.

### Headless output format

In `mode:headless`, replace the interactive report with a structured text envelope. The envelope should include:

- Scope
- Intent
- Reviewers
- Verdict
- Artifact path
- Applied safe_auto fix count
- Gated-auto findings
- Manual findings
- Advisory findings
- Pre-existing issues
- Residual risks
- Learnings & Past Solutions
- Agent-Native Gaps
- Schema Drift Check
- Deployment Notes
- Testing gaps
- Coverage
- `Review complete`

Formatting rules:

- The `[needs-verification]` marker appears only when `requires_verification: true`
- The `Artifact:` line gives callers the path to the full run artifact
- Findings with `owner: release` appear in the Advisory section
- Findings with `pre_existing: true` appear in the Pre-existing section regardless of `autofix_class`
- Omit zero-item sections
- If all reviewers fail or time out, emit `Code review degraded (headless mode). Reason: 0 of N reviewers returned results.` followed by `Review complete`

## Quality Gates

Before delivering the review, verify:

1. Every finding is actionable.
2. No false positives from skimming.
3. Severity is calibrated.
4. Line numbers are accurate.
5. Protected artifacts are respected.
6. Findings do not duplicate trivial linter output.

## Language-Aware Conditionals

Stack-specific reviewers are additive. Do not spawn them mechanically from file extensions alone; the trigger is meaningful changed behavior, architecture, or UI state in that stack.

## After Review

### Mode-Driven Post-Review Flow

After Stage 6, route next steps by mode.

#### Step 1: Build the action sets

- **Clean review** means zero findings after suppression and pre-existing separation.
- **Fixer queue:** final findings routed to `safe_auto -> review-fixer`
- **Residual actionable queue:** unresolved `gated_auto` or `manual` findings whose owner is `downstream-resolver`
- **Report-only queue:** `advisory` findings and any outputs owned by `human` or `release`

#### Step 2: Choose policy by mode

**Interactive mode**

- Apply `safe_auto -> review-fixer` findings automatically.
- Ask a blocking policy question only when `gated_auto` or `manual` findings remain.
- Adapt the question to what remains:

  When `gated_auto` findings are present:

  ```text
  Safe fixes have been applied. What should I do with the remaining findings?
  1. Review and approve specific gated fixes (Recommended)
  2. Leave as residual work
  3. Report only -- no further action
  ```

  When only `manual` findings remain:

  ```text
  Safe fixes have been applied. The remaining findings need manual resolution. What should I do?
  1. Leave as residual work (Recommended)
  2. Report only -- no further action
  ```

- Only include `gated_auto` findings in the fixer queue after explicit approval.

**Autofix mode**

- Ask no questions.
- Apply only the `safe_auto -> review-fixer` queue.
- Leave `gated_auto`, `manual`, `human`, and `release` items unresolved.

**Report-only mode**

- Ask no questions.
- Do not build a fixer queue.
- Do not create residual todos or `codereview/` artifacts.
- Stop after Stage 6.

**Headless mode**

- Ask no questions.
- Apply only the `safe_auto -> review-fixer` queue in a single pass.
- Leave other items unresolved and emit the headless envelope.
- Write a run artifact but do not create todo files.

#### Step 3: Apply fixes with one fixer and bounded rounds

- Spawn exactly one fixer sub-agent for the current fixer queue.
- Re-review only the changed scope after fixes land.
- Bound the loop with `max_rounds: 2`.
- If any applied finding has `requires_verification: true`, the round is incomplete until targeted verification runs.
- Do not start a mutating review round concurrently with browser testing on the same checkout.

#### Step 4: Emit artifacts and downstream handoff

- In interactive, autofix, and headless modes, write a per-run artifact under `codereview/<run-id>/`.
- In autofix mode, create durable todo files only for unresolved actionable findings owned by `downstream-resolver`.
- Do not create todos for `advisory`, `owner: human`, `owner: release`, or protected-artifact cleanup suggestions.

#### Step 5: Final next steps

**Interactive mode only:** after the fix-review cycle completes, offer next steps based on entry mode.

- Bits-Code MR mode:
  - Push fixes
  - Exit
- Branch mode:
  - Create a Bits-Code MR (Recommended)
  - Continue without a Bits-Code MR
  - Exit
- On the resolved review base/default branch:
  - Continue
  - Exit

**Autofix, report-only, and headless modes:** stop after the report, artifact emission, and residual-work handoff.

## Fallback

If the platform does not support parallel sub-agents, run reviewers sequentially.
