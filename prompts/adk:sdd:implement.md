## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```
You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

If the given `$ARGUMENTS` contains a link, you need to read the content of the link (use lark-docs mcp if it's a lark doc) and replace the link with content.

## Context
**Read context before Executing**:
1. Language Setting
   - Read `preferred_language` from `.ttadk/config.json` (default: 'en' if missing). **IMPORTANT** **Use the configured language for ALL outputs: 'en' → English, 'zh' → 中文. This applies to: generated documents (specs, plans, tasks), interactive prompts, confirmations, status messages, and error descriptions.**

## Outline

1. Run `node .ttadk/plugins/ttadk/core/resources/scripts/check-prerequisites.js --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
      * Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
      * Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
      * Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:
      ```
      | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
      |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
      | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
      | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
      | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
      ```
   - Calculate overall status:
      * **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
      * **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items
   
   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
      * Display the table with incomplete item counts
      * **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
      * Wait for user response before continuing
      * If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
      * If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
   
   - **If all checklists are complete**:
      * Display the table showing all checklists passed
      * Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` for guiding principles (fallback: `.ttadk/memory/constitution.md` for legacy projects) - adhere strictly during implementation
   - **REQUIRED**: Read spec.md to understand the *what* and *why* (requirements and goals)
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - **IF EXISTS**: Scan `docs/` for available knowledge assets (e.g., check `docs/arch/`, `docs/references/`, root-level `docs/*.md`). Load whichever files are relevant to the current task based on their filenames and contents — do not rely on a hardcoded list.

4. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Foundational prerequisites, user-story phases, Polish/Cross-Cutting
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

5. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow task ordering**: If test tasks exist, execute them before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

6. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Foundational prerequisites next**: Complete shared blockers before starting any user story phase
   - **Per-story execution**: Implement one user story phase at a time according to `tasks.md`
   - **Tests before code when present**: Only if `tasks.md` includes explicit test tasks for that story
   - **Polish and validation**: Complete final cross-cutting tasks, validation, and documentation updates

7. **File Writing Rules for Large Files**:
   - **> 500 lines or > 20KB → MUST use batch writing** (200-300 lines per batch)
   - **Batch workflow**: Build on existing structure (or create if missing) → Add content in batches → Verify
   - **[CRITICAL] Never write >500 lines in one operation** - Will fail and lose progress

8. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Progress Tracking (MUST follow strictly)**

   **Resume Rule**: If a task is already marked as `[X]` or `[x]`, skip it and move to the next uncompleted task. When re-entering this command, automatically continue from where you left off - do NOT start from the beginning unless the user explicitly requests to redo or fix a specific task.

   **Immediate Update Rule**: As soon as a task is completed, you MUST immediately update its status in tasks.md from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` BEFORE moving to the next task. Do NOT batch updates. Do NOT wait until the end.

   **Workflow**: Complete task → Verify completion → Update tasks.md (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) → Move to next task

   Other error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging

9. **Simplify completed implementation scope**:
   - After completing a story, phase, or other coherent implementation scope, perform a simplify pass before final completion validation.
   - First apply lightweight simplification judgment directly during implementation: prefer existing abstractions, remove obvious duplication, and avoid unnecessary complexity when this does not change behavior or expand scope.
   - Then explicitly invoke `/adk:sdd:simplify` for the completed scope (or the active story/task/files if the scope is narrower).
   - Treat simplify as a constrained post-implementation refinement pass: preserve requirement semantics, stay within the current task boundary, and avoid unrelated refactors.
   - Re-run the affected validation after simplify before proceeding.
   - When reporting this step, use concise process-oriented status updates such as: current scope is complete → start simplify pass → state simplify scope → summarize simplifications → confirm validation passed.

10. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan

11. **Final Task Completion Check**:
   - Re-read `tasks.md` and verify no `- [ ]` remains
   - If incomplete tasks exist, complete them before proceeding

12. **Unit Test Generation (bits-unit-test-gen)**:
   - Check if `bits-unit-test-gen` is listed in the available skills. If NOT found, skip this step entirely and proceed to step 13.
   - If available, collect the list of source files modified during this implement session: extract file paths from completed tasks in tasks.md, then exclude spec/doc/config files (e.g. tasks.md, spec.md, plan.md, *.yaml, *.json config, README)
   - Invoke `bits-unit-test-gen` skill, explicitly passing the collected source file list as the target scope — do NOT rely on workspace git changes auto-detection
   - The skill will: extract target functions → generate test code → compile → run tests → fix business code bugs if found → re-run validation
   - Wait for the skill to complete before proceeding
   - If the project language is unsupported by bits-unit-test-gen, the skill will notify the user and exit gracefully — proceed to step 13 regardless

13. Build and test validation:
   - After all tasks are completed, try to compile and test the project based on its build system
   - Common build systems to check:
     * `package.json` → Try `npm run build` or `npm test`
     * `Cargo.toml` → Try `cargo build` or `cargo test`
     * `go.mod` → Try `go build ./...` or `go test ./...`
     * `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` → Try Maven/Gradle commands
     * `Makefile` → Try `make` or `make test`
   - Choose the appropriate command based on the project structure
   - If compilation or tests fail, analyze the errors and fix the issues
   - Re-run the build/test until successful
   - Report final status with summary of completed work and build/test results

14. **Automatic Test Execution (SDT)**:
   - Check if test artifacts (such as `test/tasks.md` and `test/case.md`) exist in the `test` directory.
   - If these test artifacts exist, immediately execute the `/adk:sdt:implement` workflow to run the test cases and generate a test report.
   - Do not pause or ask the user for permission before doing this.
   - If no test artifacts are found, skip this step.

15. **Test Failure Triage & Business Code Fix**:
   - After `/adk:sdt:implement` completes, read the generated `test/report.md`.
   - Extract all failed test cases (❌ FAIL) from the report, including their TC-ID, title, failure reason, root cause analysis, and suggested fix.
   - Present the list of failed cases to the user in a clear table format and ask: "The following test cases failed. Which ones would you like me to fix? (Enter TC-IDs, e.g., TC-001,TC-003, or 'all' to fix all, or 'skip' to skip)"
   - **Wait for user response before proceeding.**
   - Based on the user's selection:
     - For each selected failed case, analyze the root cause and fix the **business/production code** (NOT the test cases).
     - Use the failure analysis from the report (error message, code location, root cause, fix suggestion) as guidance.
     - After fixing the business code, re-run the build/test validation (step 13) to ensure the code compiles and passes local tests.
     - Then re-execute `/adk:sdt:implement` to verify the previously failed test cases now pass.
     - If new failures appear after the re-run, repeat the triage process (present failures → ask user → fix → re-run) until all selected cases pass or the user chooses to skip.
   - If the user chooses 'skip', proceed directly to the Next Step Guidance.

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/adk:sdd:tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

## Next Step Guidance

After executing this command, provide next-step guidance to user:

### Step 1 - Confirmation
Guide user to verify the generated code is correct and meets expectations.

**If needs adjustment**:
- Run `/adk:sdd:clarify [feedback]` to update documentation
- Run `/adk:sdd:implement [feedback]` to modify the code

### Step 2 - Next Step Recommendation
Once implementation is confirmed and satisfactory:

**Commit Changes**: Execute `/adk:commit` to stage changes, generate commit message, and push to remote.
